# RobotTracker

Overhead camera tracking and analytics system for MIE444 autonomous rover competitions.

An instructor runs the **Operator Panel** (desktop app) to start/stop trials and log events. Students watch a live **Dashboard** (web browser) that updates in real time with their rover's path, distance, speed, and event timeline.

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Overhead camera | Any USB webcam that can cover the full maze; 1080p preferred |
| Camera mount | ceiling mount directly above the maze centre |
| Computer | Any machine capable of running Python 3.10+ and OpenCV |
| Network | Both operator laptop and student display must be on the same network for dashboard sharing |

**Maze dimensions configured in the system:** 8 ft × 4 ft (2438.4 mm × 1219.2 mm)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/robottracker.git
cd robottracker
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify installation

```bash
python3 -c "import cv2, streamlit, PIL; print('OK')"
```

---

## First-Time Setup — Camera Calibration

The system maps pixel positions from the camera to real-world millimetre coordinates using a homography matrix. You must calibrate once whenever the camera is moved.

### Run the interactive calibration tool

```bash
python3 main.py --calibrate
```

A window will open showing the live camera feed. **Click the four corners of the maze in this exact order:**

```
1 ── top-left          2 ── top-right
│                               │
4 ── bottom-left       3 ── bottom-right
```

The calibration tool will print four pixel coordinate pairs to the terminal and write them to `config.yaml` under `homography.pixel_points`. The `world_points` (real-world mm coordinates) are already set correctly for an 8 ft × 4 ft maze and do not need to change.



---

## Running the System

Open **two terminal windows** (or two tabs). Both must be in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.

### Step 1 — Start the Student Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Streamlit will print a local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in any browser. To share with students on the same network, use the **Network URL** printed below it.

The dashboard will display a "Waiting for trial…" message until the operator starts a trial.

### Step 2 — Launch the Operator Panel

```bash
python3 operator_ui.py
```

A desktop window will open — this is the instructor interface.

### Step 3 — Run a Trial

Follow the steps in the Operator Panel (details in the next section).

### Running a Trial — Step by Step

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| **1** | Select **Live Camera** or **Video File**, then click **Connect** |
| **2** | Wait for the live feed to appear in the left panel |
| **3** | Type the rover/team name in the **ROVER / TEAM NAME** field |
| **4** | Click **▶ START TRIAL** — the timer starts, recording begins |
| **5** | Monitor the green bounding box in the feed; log collisions/interventions as needed |
| **6** | Click **⏹ STOP TRIAL** when the run is complete |

> When using a video file: the video stays paused on the first frame after Connect. It only starts playing when you click **START TRIAL**. The trial ends automatically when the video finishes.

### Collision Logging

Click the appropriate button when the rover hits a wall:

| Button | Colour | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **Class 1** | Orange | Minor graze — rover self-recovers immediately |
| **Class 2** | Red | Moderate impact — rover briefly stalls |
| **Class 3** | Purple | Hard collision — rover gets stuck or requires recovery |

### Manual Intervention Logging

Click **🖐 MANUAL INTERVENTION** any time the instructor physically touches or repositions the rover.

---

## Student Dashboard Reference

The student dashboard auto-updates every 2 seconds while a trial is live.

### Sidebar

- **Trial selector** — automatically follows the live trial; after recording stops the last completed trial is shown. Students can also select any past trial from the dropdown.

### Path Tab

- **Map** — full-width overhead view of the maze with the rover's trajectory drawn in blue. Collision and intervention markers are shown on the path.
- **Speedometer** — current instantaneous speed of the rover.
- **Speed Over Time** — chart of rover speed across the trial duration.

### Events Tab

- Timeline of all logged events (auto-detected and manual) with timestamps.

### Stats shown

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Distance Travelled | Total path length in feet, rotation-in-place excluded |
| Max Speed | Peak speed recorded during the trial |
| Collisions | Count of wall collision events |
| Interventions | Count of manual intervention events |

---

## Configuration Reference

All tuneable parameters live in `config.yaml`. Do not hardcode values in Python files.

```yaml
maze:
  length_ft: 8.0           # Physical maze length
  width_ft: 4.0            # Physical maze width

homography:
  pixel_points:            # Four corners in pixel space — set by --calibrate
    - [x1, y1]             # top-left
    - [x2, y2]             # top-right
    - [x3, y3]             # bottom-right
    - [x4, y4]             # bottom-left

perception:
  bgs_algorithm: MOG2      # Background subtractor: MOG2 or KNN
  bgs_history: 200         # Frames used to build background model
  bgs_var_threshold: 40    # Sensitivity — lower = more sensitive
  min_contour_area_px: 500 # Minimum blob size to consider as rover (pixels²)
  max_contour_area_px: 50000
  max_jump_mm: 200         # Max allowed single-frame displacement (mm)
  max_miss_frames: 10      # Frames lost before track is reset
  position_smoothing_alpha: 0.4  # EMA smoothing — lower = smoother, more lag
  max_velocity_mms: 1500.0 # Physical speed cap (~5 ft/s)

events:
  collision_margin_mm: 50.0     # Distance from wall to trigger collision
  collision_debounce_s: 1.0     # Minimum gap between auto-detected collisions
  stop_velocity_threshold_mms: 5.0   # Speed below which rover is "stopped"
  stop_min_duration_s: 1.0      # How long stopped before logging a stop event

data:
  output_root: trials           # Directory where trial folders are saved
  trajectory_flush_every: 30    # Write CSV to disk every N frames (~1 second)

sensor:
  source: file             # "file" or "camera"
  file_path: data_/video.mp4
  camera_index: 0          # USB camera index (0 = first camera)
```

### Tuning Tips

- **Rover not detected / box appears on wrong object** → increase `min_contour_area_px` or check lighting and camera angle.
- **Tracker loses the rover mid-run** → decrease `bgs_var_threshold` (more sensitive) or increase `max_miss_frames`.
- **Distance is higher than expected** → decrease `position_smoothing_alpha` for more smoothing; the 2-second chunk + 40mm dead-band in the dashboard also filters rotation drift.
- **Auto-collision events fire incorrectly** → increase `collision_debounce_s` or switch to **Manual-only** collision mode.

---

## Logging Modes — Auto vs Manual

The Operator Panel offers two independent mode toggles:

| Toggle | Auto mode | Manual only mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Collisions** | System detects wall proximity and logs automatically | Only collisions you click with Class 1/2/3 buttons are recorded |
| **Interventions** | System detects sudden velocity jumps and logs automatically | Only interventions you click 🖐 are recorded |

These can be mixed (e.g. auto collisions + manual interventions). The mode can be changed at any time, including mid-trial.

---

## Trial Output Files

Each trial produces a folder under `trials/` named `<RoverName>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/`:

```
trials/
└── TeamAlpha_20260315_143022/
    ├── trajectory.csv        ← per-frame rover state
    ├── events.json           ← timestamped event log
    └── config_snapshot.yaml  ← exact config used for this trial
```

### trajectory.csv columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `frame_idx` | Frame number |
| `timestamp_s` | Elapsed time in seconds |
| `x_mm` | Rover X position (0 = left wall) |
| `y_mm` | Rover Y position (0 = top wall) |
| `velocity_mms` | Instantaneous speed (mm/s) |
| `heading_deg` | Heading angle (degrees, CCW from East) |
| `event_flags` | Bitmask of active event flags |

### events.json structure

```json
[
  {
    "event_type": "wall_collision",
    "timestamp_s": 14.3,
    "x_mm": 52.1,
    "y_mm": 610.4,
    "metadata": { "source": "manual", "class": "Class 2" }
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Green tracking box disappears during the run

The tracker lost the rover. Common causes and fixes:

- Camera is moving or vibrating → secure the mount
- Lighting changed (e.g. someone walked past a window) → use consistent artificial lighting
- Rover moved very fast → tracker should recover within `max_miss_frames` (default 10) frames
- `bgs_history` too low → the background model hasn't fully learned the static scene; increase to 300–500

### "Could not open file" error on Connect

- Check that the file path is correct and the video file exists
- Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`

### Camera stuck on "Connecting…"

- Verify the correct `camera_index` in `config.yaml` (try 0, 1, 2)
- On Linux: check `ls /dev/video*` to find available camera devices
- Ensure no other application is using the camera

### Dashboard not updating

- Confirm `streamlit run dashboard.py` is running in a separate terminal
- The dashboard auto-refreshes every 2 seconds — wait a moment after starting a trial
- Ensure both terminals are pointing to the same project directory (same `trials/` folder)

### Distance is unrealistically high

- Rover may have been left rotating in place — the 2-second chunk + 40 mm dead-band filter suppresses this but very fast rotation can still accumulate a small amount
- Reduce `position_smoothing_alpha` in `config.yaml` (e.g. to 0.25) for more aggressive smoothing

### Calibration / homography looks wrong (path is skewed or stretched)

- Re-run `python3 main.py --calibrate` and click the corners more precisely
- Ensure the camera is as close to directly overhead as possible; oblique angles introduce perspective error that the homography partially but not fully corrects
